# Vim Paper

A personal light theme for (Neo)Vim, based on the color of paper as found in
various notebooks.

I created Paper as a replacement for [Happy
Hacking](https://github.com/yorickpeterse/happy_hacking.vim), and the
[Autumn](https://github.com/yorickpeterse/Autumn.vim) theme it was originally
based on. I've been using dark themes for the last decade or so, and mostly
without issues. But dark themes are not necessarily a good choice for your eyes,
and research has shown that it's generally better to have dark text on a light
background (see [this StackExchange question for some interesting
data](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes)).
In addition, [halation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/halation) becomes a
problem when presenting light text on (very) dark backgrounds.

Besides the issues with dark themes, I also simply wanted a theme with fewer
colors; making the colors that _are_ used stand out more. I couldn't squeeze
this into the Happy Hacking theme without fundamentally changing it, so I
created a new theme instead.

Please note that this theme is designed with the following display properties in
mind:

* An LCD/TFT display
* A display temperature range of 4000K-5200K
* A low display brightness
